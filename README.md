```
AspNetDevTool.WPF/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Models/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ProjectInfo.cs          # Project information model
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ProjectType.cs          # Project type enumeration
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ServerStatus.cs         # Server status and monitoring
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Services/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ IProjectAnalyzer.cs     # Analysis service interface
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ProjectAnalyzer.cs      # Implementation of analysis logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ViewModels/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ MainViewModel.cs        # MVVM pattern with server management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MainWindow.xaml             # Main application window
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MainWindow.xaml.cs          # Main window code-behind
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.xaml                    # Application configuration

- **QRCoder Library** - QR code generation for mobile access
- **Advanced Process Management** - Comprehensive server lifecycle control
- **Network Programming** - Socket-based connectivity testing
- **Real-time Monitoring** - Live server output capture and status tracking

## How It Works

### 1. **Project Analysis**

- User selects a directory using the folder browser dialog
- Application scans and analyzes the selected directory
- Validates project structure and determines project type

### 2. **Server Management**

- Once a valid project is detected, server controls become available
- Start/Stop/Restart buttons for local development server
- Automatic port detection or manual configuration
- Real-time monitoring of server status and output

### 3. **Mobile Testing Workflow**

- Enable "Allow Network Access" to bind server to all network interfaces
- Click "üì± Mobile Access QR" to generate QR code for the server URL
- Scan QR code with mobile device to instantly access your development server
- Test responsive design and mobile functionality in real-time

### 4. **Advanced Development Workflow**

- Integrated browser launch for quick testing
- Live log monitoring with comprehensive error tracking
- Quick project switching and management
- Intelligent server restart with port conflict resolution
- Network connectivity diagnostics and troubleshooting

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11
- .NET 9.0 Runtime or later
- Visual Studio 2022 (for development)

### Building from Source

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `AspNetDevTool.sln` in Visual Studio
3. Restore NuGet packages (including QRCoder)
4. Build the solution (Ctrl+Shift+B)
5. Run the application (F5)

### Command Line Build

```powershell
# Restore dependencies
dotnet restore

# Build the solution
dotnet build

# Run the application
dotnet run --project AspNetDevTool.WPF
```

## Usage Guide

### Basic Usage

1. Launch ASP.NET Dev Tool
2. Click "Browse" button to select your ASP.NET project directory
3. Click "Analyze" to examine the project structure and configuration
4. Review the detailed analysis results in the project information panel
5. Configure server settings (port, HTTPS, network access)
6. Use "Start Server" to launch the development server with enhanced process management
